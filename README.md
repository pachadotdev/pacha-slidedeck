## About 

A slidedeck template that is just ok for my very particular requirements (i.e. this could fit grumpy people like me)

## How to use

* Open the index.Rmd and add your contents.
* Title, author and date can be edited in lines 24-26
* This template requires the xaringan (i.e `install.packages("xaringan")`) and icon (i.e. `devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/icon")`)

## Features

* Uses Fira Sans and Fira Code from Mozilla and Rawgit
* Includes minified CSS files for faster loading
